            <p>
              Begin your trip with Rishikesh’s poster boy, the Lakshman Jhula.
              Did you know that close to the Lakshman Jhula hangs its twin named
              Ram Jhula? Well, now you do. According to the folklore, Ramayana’s
              Lakshman crossed the Holy Ganga at this very spot using two jute
              ropes. The 450 ft long iron suspension bridge was built in 1929 to
              honor the same. It connects Pauri to Tehri.

            <p>
              Who visits Rishikesh and doesn’t go for river rafting? That’s like
              having pizza without cheese. Rafting in this tehsil starts from
              INR 600 (9 km), and goes up till INR 2500 (35 km), depending upon
              the distance and route you choose. The best months to go for river
              rafting are from February to June. It closes down in the monsoon
              season and resumes sometime in the middle of September. For those
              who’re concerned, it’s very safe if you follow the instructor’s
              instructions carefully.
